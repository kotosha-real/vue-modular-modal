# vue-modal-plugin-example

Hello!

It looks like you have read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/modular-modals-in-react-2b9bde0c5d9c).

That's great! Both discussed approaches are available at corresponding branches:

- 1-props-approach
- 2-plugin-approach

Use `git checkout branch_name` to look for the source code for each of them

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
