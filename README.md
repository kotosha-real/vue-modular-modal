# Modular Vue modals

Hello!

It looks like you have read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/modular-modals-in-react-2b9bde0c5d9c) where we discussed a couple of approaches to create modular reusable modals with Vue. That's great! You can find source code for both of the approaches at the corresponding branches:

- 1-custom-events-approach
- 2-plugin-approach

You could also check this [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/modular-vue-modals-dbfoo) out.

If you're here for another reason, I recommend you to give this [article](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/modular-modals-in-react-2b9bde0c5d9c) a look. I would appreciate any feedback!
